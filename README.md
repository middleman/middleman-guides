Middleman Guides
================

These are the source files that power the [middleman site](http://middlemanapp.com/),
a [middleman](https://github.com/middleman/middleman) powered static page.

Middleman is ever-vigilant against tag-soup, unreadable CSS and repetition. He stands-watch
over your Haml, Sass, and CoffeeScript producing only the cleanest and most efficient
markup.

## How to run the site locally

Clone this repo and using Ruby 1.9.2 run `bundle install`.
Then run `bundle exec middleman server` to start the server at `http://localhost:4567`

## Mailing List

If you have questions, answers can be found on our [community  forum](http://forum.middlemanapp.com/).

The guides are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
