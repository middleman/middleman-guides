Middleman Guides
================

These are the source files that power the [Middleman website](https://middlemanapp.com/),
which is itself a [Middleman](https://github.com/middleman/middleman)-powered static page.

The guides are the primary documentation for Middleman, explaining the core features and extensions as well as pointing out community extensions.

Middleman is ever-vigilant against tag-soup, unreadable CSS and repetition. It stands-watch
over your Haml, Sass, and CoffeeScript producing only the cleanest and most efficient
markup.
