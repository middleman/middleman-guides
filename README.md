Middleman Guides
================

These are the source files that power the [middleman site](http://middlemanapp.com/), 
a [middleman](https://github.com/tdreyno/middleman) powered static page.

Middleman is ever-vigilant against tag-soup, unreadable CSS and repetition. He stands-watch 
over your Haml, Sass, and CoffeeScript producing only the cleanest and most efficient 
markup.
