* Don't re-minify files with `.min` in their name
* Serve purely static folders directly (without `source/` and `config.rb`)
* `middleman init` generates a `Gemfile` by default.
* Errors stop the build and print a stacktrace rather than silently getting printed into files.
* `with_layout` works with globs or regexes.
* Setting `directory_index` from `page` with a glob or regex now works.
* `:gzip` extension for pre-gzipping files for better compression with no server CPU cost.
* `:asset_hash` extension that generates unique-by-content filenames for assets and rewrites references to use those filenames, so you can set far-future expires on your assets.
* Removed the `--relative` CLI option.
* Properly output Compass-generated sprited images.
* Include vendored assets in sprockets path.
* Switch built-in CSS compressor to Rainpress.
* Automatically load helper modules from `helpers/`, like Rails.
* `ignore` and `page` both work with file globs or regexes.
* `layout`, `ignore`, and `directory_index` can be set from front matter.
* JavaScript and CSS are minified no matter where they are in the site, including in inline code blocks.
* Files with just a template extension get output with the correct exension (foo.erb => foo.html)
