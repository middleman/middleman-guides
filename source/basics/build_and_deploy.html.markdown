# Exporting the Static Site (middleman build)

Finally, when you are ready to deliver static code or, in the case of "blog mode", host a static blog, you will need to build the site. Using the command-line, from the project folder, run `middleman build`:

``` bash
cd my_project
bundle exec middleman build
```

This will create a static file for each file located in your `source` folder. Template files will be compiled, static files will be copied and any enabled build-time features (such as compression) will be executed. Middleman will automatically clean out files from the build directory for you that are left over from earlier builds but would no longer be produced.
