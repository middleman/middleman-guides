# Pretty URLs (Directory Indexes)

By default Middleman will output the files exactly as you have described them
in your project. For example a `about-us.html.erb` file in the `source` folder
will be output as `about-us.html` when you build the project. If you were to
place this project in the root of a web server at `example.com`, then this page
would be accessible at: `http://example.com/about-us.html`

Middleman provides the Directory Indexes extension to tell Middleman to create
a folder for each `.html` file and place the built template file as the index
of that folder. In your `config.rb`:

```ruby
activate :directory_indexes
```

Now when the above project is built, the `about-us.html.erb` file will be
output as `about-us/index.html`. When served by a web server that supports
"index files" (like Apache, or Amazon S3), the page would be available at:

```ruby
http://example.com/about-us
```

If you prefer a different file be output, you can use the `index_file`
variable. For example, IIS uses default.html:

```ruby
set :index_file, "default.html"
```

Or, you may want a PHP file:

```ruby
set :index_file, "index.php"
```

#### Warning about assets path

When using directory indexes, calling assets (e.g. image files) by their
filename only will fail. They need to be called with their full absolute path,
like this:

```ruby
![Amazing picture](/posts/2013-09-23-some-interesting-post/amazing-image.png)
```

To slightly automate this process, the Markdown may be processed by ERB first.
For example, in a file named
`/posts/2013-09-23-some-interesting-post.html.markdown.erb`:

```ruby
![Amazing picture](<%= current_page.url %>some-image.png)
```

## Opt-out

If there are pages which you don't want automatically renamed, you can opt-out:

```ruby
page "/i-really-want-the-extension.html", :directory_index => false
```

`page` works with regexes or file globs if you want to turn off indexes for many
files at once.

You can also add a `directory_index: false` key to your page's [Frontmatter] to
disable directory indexes.

## Manual Indexes

If your template file is already named `index.html` it will pass through
Middleman untouched. For example, `my-page/index.html.erb` will generate
`my-page/index.html` as you would expect.
