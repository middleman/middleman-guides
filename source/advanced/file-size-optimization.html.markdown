# File Size Optimization

## Compressing CSS and JavaScript

Middleman handles CSS minification and Javascript compression so you don't have to worry about it. Most libraries ship minified and compressed versions of their files for users to deploy, but these files are unreadable or editable. Middleman allows you to keep the original, commented files in our project so you can easily read them and edit them if needed. Then, when you build the project, Middleman will handle all the optimization for you.

In your `config.rb`, activate the `minify_css` and `minify_javascript` features during the build of your site.

``` ruby
configure :build do
  activate :minify_css
  activate :minify_javascript
end
```

If you are already using a compressed file that includes `.min` in its filename, Middleman won't touch it. This can be good for libraries like jQuery which are carefully compressed by their authors ahead of time.

You can customize how the JavaScript compressor works by setting the `:compressor` option when activating the `:minify_javascript` extension in `config.rb` to a custom instance of Uglifier. See [Uglifier's docs](https://github.com/lautis/uglifier) for details. For example, you could enable unsafe optimizations and mangle top-level variable names like this:

``` ruby
set :js_compressor, Uglifier.new(:toplevel => true, :unsafe => true)
```

If you want to exclude any files from being minified, pass the `:ignore` option when activating these extensions, and give it one or more globs, regexes, or procs that identify the files to ignore. Likewise, you can pass an `:exts` option to change which file extensions are renamed.

You can speed up your JavaScript minification (and CoffeeScript builds) by including these gems in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'therubyracer' # faster JS compiles
gem 'oj' # faster JS compiles
```

## GZIP text files

It's a good idea to [serve compressed files](http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#gzip) to user agents that can handle it. Many web servers have the ability to gzip files on the fly, but that requires CPU work every time the file is served, and as a result most servers don't perform the maximum compression. Middleman can produce gzipped versions of your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript alongside your regular files, and you can instruct your web server to serve those pre-gzipped files directly. First, enable the `:gzip` extension:

``` ruby
activate :gzip
```

Then configure your server to serve those files. If you use Nginx, check out [the gzip_static](http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxHttpGzipStaticModule) module. For Apache, you'll have to do something a little trickier - see [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/2200790) for an example.

## Compressing Images

If you also want to compress images on build, try [`middleman-imageoptim`](https://github.com/plasticine/middleman-imageoptim).

## Minify HTML

Middleman provides an official extension for minifying its HTML output. Simply install the gem:

``` bash
gem install middleman-minify-html
```

Add `middleman-minify-html` to your `Gemfile`: 

``` ruby
gem "middleman-minify-html"
```

Then open your `config.rb` and add:

``` ruby
activate :minify_html
```

You should notice whilst view-source:'ing that your HTML is now being minified.
