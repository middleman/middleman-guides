# Rack Middleware

Rack is a system of classes that can modify content on-the-fly and intercept requests before they are processed by the server (Middleman).

Middleman has full access to Rack Middleware which opens up an expansive universe of libraries which work with Middleman.

## Example: Syntax Highlighting

This site is written in Middleman and features many code blocks which have syntax highlighting. This syntax highlighting is accomplished outside the scope of Middleman. This site renders `<code>` blocks and then Rack Middleware takes over an enhances those blocks with syntax highlight. The middleware in use is called [`Rack::Codehighlighter`](https://github.com/wbzyl/rack-codehighlighter). Here's how it can be used in your `config.rb`:
  
    :::ruby
    require 'rack/codehighlighter'
    require "pygments"
    use Rack::Codehighlighter, 
      :pygments,
      :element => "pre>code",
      :pattern => /\A:::([-_+\w]+)\s*\n/,
      :markdown => true

Make sure you add the right dependencies to your `Gemfile` to make those work:
  
    :::ruby
    gem "rack-codehighlighter", :git => "git://github.com/wbzyl/rack-codehighlighter.git"
    gem "pygments.rb"

The above block required the `rack/codehighlighter` and `pygments.rb` libraries. Then the `use` command tells Middleman to use this middleware. The rest is standard Rack Middleware setup, passing some variables to the middleware itself instructing the syntax highlighter on how to locate code blocks and which backend to use for parsing the syntax.

### Build Cycle

The Rack Middleware is run on all requests, including those done during the build cycle. This means anything the Rack Middleware effects during preview will be present in the built files. However, be aware that once the project is built, it is a static site. Rack Middleware which does processing on requests, expecting things like cookies, sessions or variables, won't work once the site is built.
