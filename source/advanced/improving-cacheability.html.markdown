# Improving Cacheability

To make your website render as quickly as possible, you should serve any assets, like JavaScript, CSS, or images, with proper headers that instruct web browsers to [cache them for a very long time](https://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/caching.html). This means that when users visit your site again (or even just go to another page in your site) they don't have to re-download those assets. However, setting a far-future `Expires` or `Cache-Control` header can cause problems when you change your assets but users are still using their cached versions. Middleman has two approaches to solve this problem for you.

## Uniquely-named assets

The most effective technique for preventing users from using outdated files is to change the asset's filename every time you change one of your assets. Since that would be a pain to do by hand, Middleman comes with an `:asset_hash` extension that does it for you. First, activate the extension in your `config.rb`:

    :::ruby
    activate :asset_hash
    
Now, refer to your assets as normal, with their original filename. You can use helpers like `image_tag` as well. However, when your site is built, each asset will be produced with a bit of extra text at the end of the filename that is tied to the content of the file, and all of your other files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc) will be changed to reference that unique-ified filename instead of the original one. Now you can serve your assets with a "never expire" policy, but be sure that when you change them, they'll show up as a different filename.

However, because this extension works by rewriting your files to reference the renamed assets, it's possible the extension might mess up and miss a reference, or do something you don't want to your code. In that case, you might have to fall back to the older cache buster method.

## Cache buster in query string

The second approach is to append a value to the end of URLs that reference your assets. For example, instead of referencing `my_image.png` you'd reference `my_image.png?1234115152`. The extra info at the end of the URL is enough to tell many (but not all) browsers and proxies to cache that file separately from the same file with a different cache buster value. To use this, activate the `:cache_buster` extension in your `config.rb`:

    :::ruby
    activate :cache_buster
    
Now, to use cache-safe URLs, you must use [asset path helpers](http://www.padrinorb.com/api/Padrino/Helpers/AssetTagHelpers.html) like `image_path` or `javascript_include_tag`. Make sure to use [Compass helpers](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/helpers/urls/) in your SASS too (`image-url`, etc.). For JavaScript, you'll need to make ERb templates like `my script.js.erb` and call asset helpers via ERb tags to output the right values. If you forget one, your users will still get the file (since the copy on the server just has a normal name) but they might not see changes.

## Configuring your server

Configuring your server to use far-future `Expires` and `Cache-Control` headers is different depending on which server you use. See Google's [page speed docs](https://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/caching.html) for links on how to configure your particular server, and run [Google Page Speed](https://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/extension.html) or [YSlow](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yslow/) to check that you've configured things correctly.
